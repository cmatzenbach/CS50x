Projects worked on for Harvard's CS50 Programming Course, taught by David Malan (http://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science).  LaunchCode partnered with Harvard to bring this program to other cities, and I began the Miami program on June 2016.  Covering all programming, computer science, and algorithm fundamentals, the class taught C (pset1 - pset6), PHP/MySql (pset7), and JavaScript/jQuery/AJAX/APIs/JSON (pset8).  These are all the programs I built for the class, all completed and verified to meet all benchmarks.
